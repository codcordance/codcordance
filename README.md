### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !

âš¡ I'm Codcordance (or Concordance, it depends on the website :p). My real name is RÃ©my SIAHAAN--GENSOLLEN, and i'm a student at the _ENSAE Paris_, in the _Institut Polytechnique de Paris_. I am passionate about mathematics, physics, and computer science, particularly data science and machine learning. These are the fields in which I am studying, and as such, you can find some of my work for the hackathons I have won in my repositories.
